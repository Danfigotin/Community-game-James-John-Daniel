Hope: One who has a vision for the future must consider the past.

Which is why we're making a fighting game!<br>

# Log December 11
1. Project Progress
- We have a option scene.
- We have the start screen.
- We have different maps for the game.
- We have different diffculties.


2. Still Needs To Be Done
- Blocking button.
- Large attack.
 

3. What We Are "Thinking" About Doing
- We may change the start screen.



# Wiki 
- The game is kinda like "Super smash bros" and "streat fighter".
- Its a 3rd person game.
- Theres 2 characters, a "ninja guy" and "lexus?".
- The characters fight until one of them has no health left on the bar.


# How to play
- At the start you will see a start screen that says press "ENTER" to start, when you press "Enter" it will change a scene to the option scene after that you it will ask you to pick the map, how many players are you playing with and the difficulty after you choose the stuff that you wanted, it's the best part you fianlly get to play the game!
- To move player one you must use "a,w,s,d" and to move the second player (we still not sure).
- The fighting buttons are still in progress.
