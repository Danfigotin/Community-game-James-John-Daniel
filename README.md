1. Project Progress
- We have a option scene.
- We have the start screen.
- We have different maps for the game.
- We have different diffculties.

2. Still Needs To Be Done
- We still need to make the characters.
- We still need to make, when a button is pressed it needs go to a specific scene for example, when you choose a specific map it goes to that map scene.
- We need to make the option scene a bit more "cool" so, we need to put like images.
- We need to make the fighting buttons.

3. What We Are "Thinking" About Doing
- We are trying to figure out how to make the buttons go to the scene that they are supposed to go to.
- We are trying to put some "cool" images to the option scene.
- We may change the start screen
-
